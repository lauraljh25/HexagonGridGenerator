# HexagonGridGenerator
Generate a grid of hexagons with a custom number of rows and columns

Made using WPF (windows presentation forms) for the GUI and C#. The Hexagons are the polygon control that are added to a canvas panel. The number of hexagons that appear on the canvas is determined by the number of rows or columns specified by the user.

Feel free to look at and use the code.
